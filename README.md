##  Project Overview

This is a front-end layout inspired by Amazon’s homepage, developed using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**.  
The project helped me explore layout design, responsive structure, and real-world UI elements without using any CSS frameworks or JavaScript.

##  Why I Built This

I wanted to test my ability to recreate a professional e-commerce layout using only basic front-end tools.  
Amazon’s homepage was a great example to follow and recreate from scratch — it gave me a clear goal while helping me understand complex layout building.

##  Key Features

- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- Custom header with logo, search bar, and navigation links  
- Product section grid built using Flexbox and CSS Grid  
- Image banners and section dividers  
- Footer with categorized link sections

##  Challenges I Faced

- Designing responsive sections without Bootstrap  
- Aligning the header content across different screen sizes  
- Maintaining spacing and alignment consistency across sections  
- Naming and organizing CSS classes properly

##  Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for cart functionality and interactivity  
- Load real or dummy product data using JSON  
- Add hover animations and dropdown menus  
- Implement dark mode using CSS variables

##  Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Flexbox  
- CSS Grid  
- Font Awesome (for icons)

##  What I Learned

This project helped me improve in:
- Responsive web design  
- Layout structuring using Flexbox and Grid  
- Writing clean, readable CSS  
- Organizing HTML files professionally  
- Recreating real-world website UI from scratch
